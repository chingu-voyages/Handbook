# Welcome to Chingu! 👋🏾 👋🏻 👋🏽 👋🏿 👋🏼 👋


## What does "Chingu" mean 🤔?
Chingu means ‘friend’ in Korean. 

When this community began, one of our cofounders decided this would be it's name based on time spent in South Korea. 

### Who are we and what do we do? 

Gather round it’s story time 📖

A long time ago (2016) in the land of the *World Wide Web*, the idea to build a community of people learning to code was formed. Now, this wasn’t a novel idea, but the possibility of building a global community was fascinating.

The idea was this: gather people from around the world interested in learning to code, self-taught, in bootcamps, stuck in tutorial purgatory, and build a structured environment for free to learn and grow together by working on projects and get hired.  

The call went out and over time, the community grew, and grew and grew! Many of us began learning on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

It was exciting to see devs of all levels working on remote projects together. We had some ambitious Chingu’s who built scavenger hunts and New Year's Eve puzzles for the community to solve. It was quite the place to be in the early days. We kept growing and here we are today, still focused on serving the community. 

We expanded to include more team roles that align with traditional dev and product teams. We try our best to expose our members to real-world scenarios.

Chingu’s mission of helping people gain skills hasn’t changed. However, to maintain our goals (and sanity), we shifted from trying to offer several free services to a few. One of those services is: **Voyages**.

## ⛵ Voyages 
6-week remote team projects where members level up to help them land their dream jobs by:

* Being accountable to their team commitments and themselves.
* Improving soft skills like teamwork, collaboration, and project management.
* Putting the technical knowledge gained into practice.

## How does Chingu operate 💻 ? 
With a wonderful and growing team who volunteer their time in addition to having personal lives, raising families, jobs and other responsibilities. 

## Has it been easy? 
Nope. 

It has been rewarding though. 
Meeting people around the world, celebrating new jobs, and learning both soft and technical skills. In all communities, especially one this size (Chingu's represent 90 countries) there are bound to be challenges, disagreements, and misunderstandings. We work through what we can and graciously depart with Chingu’s when we can’t reach common ground. 

There is a ZERO TOLERANCE policy for: racism, sexism, trolling, unwanted DMs, explicit content etc. If you experience something uncomfortable, notify the admins or moderators. As if you were at the airport: see something, say something.

## How do you pay the bills 💰?
With support from fellow Chingu’s who purchase [merch](https://chingu.myspreadshop.com), [buy us a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chingu) and other donations. No one receives payment, salary, etc. 

## If Chingu has been operating for several years, why is this repo new?
The Handbook (coming to GitHub soon) currently lives on a different platform. Recently, we decided to move it to GitHub for the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>Provides our members the opportunity to gain experience with an Open Source project.</li>
  <li>Provide visibility into some of the projects our members of all levels are contributing to. </li>
  <li>Reduced context switching.</li>
</ul>

## How can I join 🤩 ?
Go [here](https://www.chingu.io) - the website is currently being overhauled and still functional. Changes are coming! 

We look forward to chatting with you in Discord!
