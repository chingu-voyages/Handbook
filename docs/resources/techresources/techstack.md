# Choosing your Techstack

![Team choosing a technical stack](./assets/Team_choosing_techstack.jpeg)

Products and languages in the tech stack are divided into four basic
categories - frontend, backend, database, and DevOps. The components that make
up web applications are also divided between two categories:

- *[Frontend](https://www.notion.so/Glossary-c0b10b9e0c9a4e80a0c3482433fb08a4?pvs=21)-only
  application* - Composed of only frontend products and languages and runs
  exclusively in the user's browser.
- *[Full stack](https://www.notion.so/Glossary-c0b10b9e0c9a4e80a0c3482433fb08a4?pvs=21)* [](https://docs.chingu.io/glossary#fullstack)*application* -
  Composed of at least a frontend and backend, but may optionally include
  database and DevOps components.

The following lists some of the more popular products and languages to provide a
view of how they are categorized. Remember that there are literally thousands of
products Web Developers may choose from in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Chingu's are not limited to any particular programming language, library,
framework, or DBMS. However, in any team project, like a Voyage, the choice of
components in a technical stack is a _team decision_. In addition, we strongly
recommend that no more than 15% of the technical stack be new to more than
half of the team in a Voyage due to its short duration.

## Deployment Options

Well before you've reached the MVP milestone for your application you'll want
to deploy it to the Internet so your team can perform integration testing and
get everything set up to incrementally deploy what you've completed at the end
of **_every_** sprint.

You can learn more about the options for web hosting in the
[App Deployment](./appdeployment.md) topic of this Guide.
