# UI/UX - A workflow for Voyage teams

![UI/UX Designer at work](./assets/UI_UX_designer_at_work.jpeg)

In any application team the UI/UX Designer is an important role which helps
teams design and implement a UI/UX thats easy to use, pleasent to view,
responsive, and accessible. But, sometimes UI/UX Designers aren't available to
join a Development team.

The purpose of this section is to provide teams with a simple workflow they can
use to implement a website design when a UI/UX Designer isn't available.

### 1. Product Strategy

#### 1.1 Cast your App Vision

**_Objective:_** Define the problem to be solved and the value the app will provide to its users.

**_How?_**
* What problem will your app solve for its users?
* You should create this as a team as defined in the Voyage Sprint 1 process we've provided [here](../../guides/voyage/voyage.md#4-choose-a-project--create-a-vision-statement-)

**_Resources:_**

---
#### 1.2 Define the User Personas

**_Objective:_** Define the types of users who will be using the app.

**_How?_**
* Who, specifically, will use the app? 
* Name them, and then as you design your site be sure to consider their wants and needs.
* Personas shouldn't be complex or take a lot of time to create in a Voyage project. Here's a simple template to use:

```mermaid
block-beta
  columns 1
  block:TEMPLATE
    columns 2
    NAME("Name")
    VNAME("Casual User")
    DEMOGRAPHICS("Background, lifestyle, & behavioral practices")
    VDEMOGRAPHICS("Not computer savvy</br>Deals with many interruptions</br>Short attention span")
    GOALS("Goals & frustruations")
    VGOALS("Wants quick access to public info</br>Doesn't need confidential info</br>Appreciates additional feedback")
    MOTIVATIONS("Motivations")
    VMOTIVATIONS("Uses app to provide support to other customers")
  end
  style TEMPLATE fill:#aed6f1
  style NAME color:#f0f6fc, fill:#21618c
  style DEMOGRAPHICS color:#f0f6fc, fill:#21618c
  style GOALS color:#f0f6fc, fill:#21618c
  style MOTIVATIONS color:#f0f6fc, fill:#21618c
```

---
#### 1.3 Write the User Stories

**_Objective:_** Define the functionality to be implemented.

**_How?_**
* What discrete tasks will each user need to accomplish when using your app?
* User stories have a simple format that captures the persona performing the task, what they need to do, and the value it provides to them.

```mermaid
block-beta
  columns 1
  block:TEMPLATE
    columns 2
    WHO("As a <persona>")
    VWHO("Casual User")
    WANT("I want to...")
    VWANT("Access the corporate event schedule for the next month")
    BENEFIT("So I can...")
    VBENEFIT("During a customer support call</br>quickly locate the events they</br>are interested in attending</br>and relay the details to them")
  end
  style TEMPLATE fill:#aed6f1
  style WHO color:#f0f6fc, fill:#21618c
  style WANT color:#f0f6fc, fill:#21618c
  style BENEFIT color:#f0f6fc, fill:#21618c
```

---
#### 1.4 Prioritize the Feature List

**_Objective:_** Prioritize your list of essential user stories and tasks

**_How?_**
* Which user stories are core to your app’s purpose? 
* What can you reasonably expect to achieve in a six-week voyage?
* You should create this as a team as defined in the Voyage Sprint 1 process we've provided [here](../../guides/voyage/voyage.md#5-define--prioritize-mvp-features-)

---
### 2. Product Structure

#### 2.1 Wireframe Your App

**_Objective:_** Create a sketch to identify common parts of your UI/UX.

**_How?_**
* What pages will your app need? 
* What components (header, footer, etc.) will be used again and again on every page?
* What should be displayed and/or what actions should be available for each view? 
* How should they be laid out? Create a sketch!
* For the primary user stories, chart the path your user will take from screen to screen to accomplish their task.
* You may use a tool like [Figma](https://figma.com) to build your wireframe, but a hand-drawn sketch is usually a faster approach

* [Low Fidelity Wireframes](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/low-fidelity-wireframes/)
---
#### 2.2 Wireframe the Interactivity

**_Objective:_** Identify how application state changes in response to user actions.

**_How?_**
* Note how state changes for each component based on different actions, like the click of a button or data entered into a field.

### 3. Product Style

#### 3.1 Finalize your Brand Personality

**_Objective:_** Choose a unique and descriptive name for your app.

**_How?_**
* Name the app and describe its character with words like playful or reliable, dynamic or solid, etc.
* This is a team effort and something you will have most likely already done in Sprint 1

**_Resources:_**

* [How to choose the perfect name for your app](https://www.goodbarber.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-perfect-name-for-your-app-a696/)
---
#### 3.2 Create a Visual Style Guide 

**_Objective:_** Create a theme that gives your app a consistent look and feel.

**_How?_**
* Create your color scheme and typography, decide on an icon set, and explore the possibility of bringing in images or illustrations.
* There are a lot of tools available to create and render style guides. But, the simplest approach is to embed your style guide in the `readme.md` in your repo
To embed your app’s style guide into a README.md file, follow these steps:

  1. Use Markdown syntax: Write your style guide in Markdown syntax, using formatting options like headings, bold text, and code blocks. This will make it easy to read and maintain.
  2. Include examples: Provide concrete examples of each style guideline, using code snippets or images. This will help developers understand how to apply the guidelines in their code.
  3. Link to additional resources: If you have additional resources (e.g., design files, style guides in other formats), link to them from your README.md file.
  4. Integrate into README.md: In your README.md file, create a section dedicated to your app’s style guide. Use a clear heading (e.g., “Style Guide”) and provide a brief introduction to the guidelines.
  5. Maintain and update: Regularly review and update your style guide to ensure it remains consistent and accurate.

* Here's a sample template to follow:
```
