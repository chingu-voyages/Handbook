# Solo Project Guide

## Overview

The goal of the Solo Project is to help you and the Chingu team verify that
you've chosen a Tier that gives you the best chance of success in a Voyage. It
also gives you another app you can add to your portfolio.

When you are done and have submitted your Solo Project our team will 
evaluate your project and provide feedback you can use on both functionality 
as well as your UI/UX.

provided specifications for.

One of our Facilitators will evaluate your Solo Project and will DM you in 
Discord with feedback you can use! They will look at both your code as well 
as the running app so you'll get 360-degree feedback.

### 4. Submit a Solo Project Completion Form
    
When you've completed your Solo Project you will need to submit the **[Solo Project Completion Form](https://forms.gle/4qiLptoNdfkfaDVv9)** before you can move on to the Voyage Project.

> You are encouraged to submit this form as soon as your Solo Project is done. There is no need to wait until the submission deadline if you finish earlier.
> 

Once you submit the Solo Project Completion Form your project will be 
evaluated and a member of the Facilitation Team will provide you with 
status in a Discord direct message (DM).

There is no need to resubmit the completion form once you've received 
feedback. If any rework is requested you can open a support ticket 
[here](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/1105911757177888908)
when you are ready for your project to be retested.
    
## Solo Project Requirements & Specifications
    
If you don't already have a project to submit you can create one from the following list. Simply pick a Solo Project that matches the tier you've chosen and click on the 'X' to see a detailed description, and what is required to complete it.
    
## Solo Project Prerequisites
    
- Your project should match the requirements of the 
[tier you have chosen](#1-choose-your-tier)
- Project source code must be hosted on GitHub
- Completed project must be deployed on the Internet.
- You'll be asked to provide the URLs for both your GitHub repo and the [deployed application](https://www.notion.so/Choosing-your-Techstack-b6afc20e86c84cdc99f6fb502218aa95?pvs=21) when you submit the [Solo Project Completion Form](https://forms.gle/4qiLptoNdfkfaDVv9) for your project.

Remember that you are required to produce original work! You should not copy and submit a solo project you did not personally author. For more information refer to our [Community Standards](https://www.notion.so/Community-Standards-2ffc6ee107964b35bff5201554798fb0?pvs=21).
    
## Solo Project Tips
    
1. It is more important to complete the project than it is to add features since completion is required before you can advance to the Voyage Project.
2. Concentrate on completing the required tasks for your tier and then work on bonus tasks only if time permits. Keep in mind that advancing to the Voyage phase of the Cohort depends on the completion of the required tasks listed in the project repo we've provided.
3. Choose tools you are comfortable and productive with. In the limited time available to complete the Solo Project it's not a good idea to try to use something you don't already know.
4. Unless otherwise noted in the required tasks for you tiers Solo Project the languages, tools, libraries, and frameworks you use are up to you. For example, all of the following approaches are acceptable paths to a successful project:
    - Using any language for web development, not just Javascript
    - Using Vanilla JS instead of a library or framework
    - Using a framework of your choice like React or Vue
    - Using a boilerplate or generator like Create React App (CRA)
    - Using a CSS library or creating your own CSS
5. Your repo should contain a well written [readme](https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d).
6. Remember that your app should run error-free. There should be no errors in the browser or server console logs.
7. Identify and handle [edge cases](https://www.notion.so/Move-from-Jim-s-Notion-account-to-the-Chingu-account-3731fed465b641ebacdfa74d52fd6b2f?pvs=21)
8. When you submit your project ***you must provide URL's for***: 
    - the publicly accessible repository containing your project (eg. Github).
    - the running version of your project where you have deployed it on an 
    Internet accessible host (eg. Github Pages, Netlify, etc.) so we can evaluate not
    just your code, but also your UI/UX.
9. You may **NOT** use a source code generator (like GitHub Co-Pilot) to 
create any part of your Solo Project.
10. Chingu is all about collaborative learning and supporting each other as
    we level up! Use our Discord channels to get help and advice.
