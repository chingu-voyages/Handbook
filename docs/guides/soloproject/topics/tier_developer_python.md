<td>Tier&nbsp;3: Intermediate-Advanced Applications (Real-World Skills)</td>
<td>
<p>This tier is for developers with intermediate or advanced competency in Python development</p>
<strong>Skills:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> Basic pandas and numpy for data analysis and transformation.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Data Handling Techniques:</strong> Master efficient, secure, and scalable processing of complex file formats (CSV, JSON, XML, and beyond) with schema validation, real-time streaming, and cloud integration.</li>

    <li><strong>Concurrency & Parallelism:</strong> Optimize performance with threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio for handling multiple tasks efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Automation:</strong> Writing scripts to automate file management or data processing tasks.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tools:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Mastery of a full-fledged IDE like WebStorm or advanced usage of Visual Studio Code</li>
    <li>API Development Tools: Advanced use of REST or GraphQL API tools, including API design and documentation tools like Swagger or Apollo.</li>
    <li>Database Management Tools: Familiarity with database tools and ORMs for interacting with SQL (like PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).</li>
</ul>

<p>Your Solo Project <strong><em>must</em></strong> showcase at least 3/6 of the above skills, and most skills in tiers 1 and 2. The project must be deployed, or a demo video can be used instead of a deployment. It must be a fully working app similar to, but not limited to the below examples,</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Extract data from websites using libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium. Learn techniques for navigating dynamic content, handling pagination, respecting robots.txt, and managing request throttling to avoid detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Discord Bots:</strong> Develop bots to automate tasks, provide real-time notifications, or integrate with APIs. Examples include AI-powered chatbots, music streaming bots, gaming stats trackers, and server moderation tools. Use frameworks like discord.py or Discord.js, and implement concurrency with asyncio for handling multiple events efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processing & Analytics Tools:</strong> Build applications that analyze, transform, and visualize large datasets. Use pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis. Examples include financial analysis dashboards, sales trend predictors, and social media analytics platforms. Extend functionality with cloud-based data pipelines for real-time insights.</li>
    <li><strong>API-Based Applications:</strong> Design and consume RESTful or GraphQL APIs to interact with external services. Build applications that integrate with third-party APIs like payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), social media (Twitter, Reddit), or weather services. Examples include automated trading bots, data aggregation tools, and API performance monitors.</li>
    <li><strong>Task Automation & Workflow Optimization:</strong> Write scripts that automate repetitive tasks such as data entry, file management, report generation, or email notifications. Use tools like cron jobs, Selenium, and Robocorp for automation. Examples include a file backup system, automated invoice processing, and email summarization bots.</li>
    <li><strong>AI & Machine Learning Applications:</strong> Implement machine learning models for predictions, classification, and recommendations. Use libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, or PyTorch to create applications such as fraud detection systems, AI-driven resume matching tools, or sentiment analysis platforms for customer feedback.</li>
