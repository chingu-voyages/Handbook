## Tier Requirements

### Tier 1: Beginner Frontend

This tier is for developers who are just starting out in web development.

***Skills***:
* Basic understanding of CSS and HTML.
* Familiarity with at least one programming language (Python, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, etc.)
* Experience with either Web Components or a front-end framework such as React, Vue, Angular, etc.
* Ability to create and deploy a webpage to the Internet that dynamically interacts with events such as buttons and form fields to alter the information displayed on the screen.

***Tools***:
* ***Code Editor***: Familiarity with a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Neovim, Webstorm, etc.
* ***Git/GitHub***: Basic understanding of how to use Git/GitHub. Familiarity with cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing code.
* ***Web Development Tools***: Basic use of browser developer tools for debugging HTML and CSS.
* ***Deployment Tools***: Hosting services to deploy static web pages such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Render, Railway, etc.

Your Solo Project ***must*** be defined using CSS and HTML, which also uses logic (designed and written by you) which dynamically processes events and inputs to display or modify information on the screen.

Tier 1 Chingus will use a programming language in addition to a framework such as React, Vue, Svelte, etc. If you haven't yet learned a FE framework, you will need to learn that skill before submitting a Solo Project and joining a Voyage. We recommend [Scrimba](../../../gettingstarted/partners.md)

### Tier 2: Advanced Frontend

This tier is for developers who have a solid foundation in web development.

***Skills:***
* Intermediate HTML and CSS.
* Intermediate or advanced programming experience with JavaScript/PHP/Python/Ruby/etc.
* Understanding of CSS preprocessors like SASS, LESS, Stylus, or TailwindCSS.
* Understanding of Responsive Web Design basics.
* Understanding of how to use an API to retrieve data from a backend system.
* Experience with either Web Components or a front-end framework such as React, Vue, Angular, etc.

***Tools***:
* ***Advanced Code Editor Usage***: Proficient use of code editors with advanced features such as integrated terminals, version control systems, and debugging tools.
* ***Git/GitHub***: Familiarity with Git/GitHub concepts such as branching, merging, pull requests, and resolving conflicts.
* ***Web Development Tools***: Intermediate use of browser developer tools for debugging HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
* ***Deployment Tools***: Familiarity with deployment tools such as Netlify, Vercel, Railway, Render, or similar services* 

Your Solo Project ***must implement*** a front-end app as follows:
* Written using either Web Components or a framework such as React, Svelte, VueJS, etc.
* Implement logic (designed and written by you) which dynamically processes events and inputs to display or modify information on the screen.

### Tier 3: Fullstack

This tier is for developers with intermediate or advanced competency in web development technologies.

***Skills:***
* Intermediate or Advanced HTML and CSS
* Intermediate or advanced programming experience with JavaScript/PHP/Python/Ruby/etc.
* Experience in a framework/library like React, Vue, Angular, etc.
* Understanding of how to create and use APIs with REST or GraphQL API.
* Ability to create a backend server which implements an API of your own design using packages such as Express.

***Tools:***
* ***Integrated Development Environment (IDE)***: Mastery of a full-fledged IDE like WebStorm or advanced usage of Visual Studio Code for full-stack development.
* ***API Development Tools***: Advanced use of REST or GraphQL API tools, including API design and documentation tools like Swagger or Apollo.
* ***Database Management Tools***: Familiarity with database tools and ORMs for interacting with SQL (like PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).

Your Solo Project ***must*** meet these criteria:
* Must include distinct files which separate the FE and BE application logic in a way the follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
* If the app accesses a database it must be accessed only from the BE logic. Applications that access databases from FE logic will not be accepted.
* The BE logic must implement an app-specific API that is only implemented in the BE. The FE must access the BE API to deliver services to the end user.
* Applications that use technology like Firebase only for authentication are not acceptable. Apps which couple this form of authentication with application specific API are acceptable.
* The FE logic must include logic developed by the Chingu that operates on the data to transform it, change it, or present it to the end user
* It must implement a front-end application that accesses a back-end server that implements an API of your own design, optionally using a database such as a NoSQL DBMS like MongoDB or a SQL DBMS like PostgreSQL.
* Your backend must include CRUD (if using a database) or POST/READ/UPDATE/DELETE (for APIs).
