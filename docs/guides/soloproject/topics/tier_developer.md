<td>Tier&nbsp;1</td>
<td>
<p>This tier is for developers who are just starting out in web development.</p>
<strong>Skills:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Basic understanding of CSS and HTML.</li>
    <li>Familiarity with at least one programming language (Python, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, etc.)</li>
    <li>Experience with either Web Components or a front-end framework such as React, Vue, Angular, etc.</li>
    <li>Ability to create and deploy a webpage to the Internet that dynamically interacts with events such as buttons and form fields to alter the information displayed on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tools</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Code Editor: Familiarity with a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Neovim, Webstorm, etc.</li>
    <li>Git/GitHub: Basic understanding of how to use Git/GitHub. Familiarity with cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing code.</li>
    <li>Web Development Tools: Basic use of browser developer tools for debugging HTML and CSS.</li>
    <li>Deployment Tools: Hosting services to deploy static web pages such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Render, Railway, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your Solo Project <strong><em>must</em></strong> be defined using CSS and HTML, which also uses logic (designed and written by you) which dynamically processes events and inputs to display or modify information on the screen.</p>

Tier 1 Chingus will use a programming language in addition to a framework such as React, Vue, Svelte, etc. If you haven't yet learned a FE framework, you will need to learn that skill before submitting a Solo Project and joining a Voyage. We recommend [Scrimba](../../gettingstarted/partners.md)

<p>This tier is for developers who have a solid foundation in web development.</p>
<strong>Skills:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Intermediate HTML and CSS.</li>
    <li>Intermediate or advanced programming experience with JavaScript/PHP/Python/Ruby/etc.</li>
    <li>Understanding of CSS preprocessors like SASS, LESS, Stylus, or TailwindCSS.</li>
    <li>Understanding of Responsive Web Design basics.</li>
    <li>Understanding of how to use an API to retrieve data from a backend system.</li>
    <li>Experience with either Web Components or a front-end framework such as React, Vue, Angular, etc.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tools</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Advanced Code Editor Usage: Proficient use of code editors with advanced features such as integrated terminals, version control systems, and debugging tools.</li>
    <li>Git/GitHub: Familiarity with Git/GitHub concepts such as branching, merging, pull requests, and resolving conflicts.</li>
    <li>Web Development Tools: Intermediate use of browser developer tools for debugging HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
    <li>Deployment Tools: Familiarity with deployment tools such as Netlify, Vercel, Railway, Render, or similar services<li>
</ul>

<p>Your Solo Project <strong><em>must implement</em></strong> a front-end app as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Written using either Web Components or a framework such as React, Svelte, VueJS, etc.</li>
    <li>Implement logic (designed and written by you) which dynamically processes events and inputs to display or modify information on the screen.</li>
</ul>

<td>Tier&nbsp;3</td>
<td>
<p>This tier is for developers with intermediate or advanced competency in web development technologies.</p>
<strong>Skills:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Intermediate or Advanced HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Intermediate or advanced programming experience with JavaScript/PHP/Python/Ruby/etc.
    <li>Experience in a framework/library like React, Vue, Angular, etc.
    <li>Understanding of how to create and use APIs with REST or GraphQL API.
    <li>Ability to create a backend server which implements an API of your own design using packages such as Express.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tools:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Mastery of a full-fledged IDE like WebStorm or advanced usage of Visual Studio Code for full-stack development.</li>
    <li>API Development Tools: Advanced use of REST or GraphQL API tools, including API design and documentation tools like Swagger or Apollo.</li>
    <li>Database Management Tools: Familiarity with database tools and ORMs for interacting with SQL (like PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).</li>
</ul>

<p>Your Solo Project <strong><em>must</em></strong> meet these criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Must include distinct files which separate the FE and BE application logic in a way the follows the Separation of Responsibility Principle (SRP).</li>
    <li>If the app accesses a database it must be accessed only from the BE logic. Applications that access databases from FE logic will not be accepted.</li>
    <li>The BE logic must implement an app-specific API that is only implemented in the BE. The FE must access the BE API to deliver services to the end user.</li>
    <li>Applications that use technology like Firebase only for authentication are not acceptable. Apps which couple this form of authentication with application specific API are acceptable.</li>
    <li>The FE logic must include logic developed by the Chingu that operates on the data to transform it, change it, or present it to the end userIt must implement a front-end application that accesses a back-end server that implements an API of your own design, optionally using a database such as a NoSQL DBMS like MongoDB or a SQL DBMS like PostgreSQL.</li>
    <li>Your backend must include CRUD (if using a database) or POST/READ/UPDATE/DELETE (for APIs).</li>
</ul>
