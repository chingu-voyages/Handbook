# Scrum Master Tiers
![Solo Project topic image](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-yellow.jpg)

All Scrum Masters are welcome at Chingu, regardless of whether they have training or a certification. However, participation is regulated to ensure they have the skills needed to guide Voyage teams in a effective manner.

> If you are a Scrum Master requiring training or perhaps a refresher we recommend you consider [The Job Hackers](https://www.thejobhackers.org).

Scrum Master duties and responsibilities are the same regardless of what tier they are placed in during a Voyage. For this reason SM's are't asked to choose a tier when submitting a Solo Project.

However, they should meet these requirements, which are the minimum needed to successfully guide a Voyage team.

* ***Scrum knowledge***: In-depth understanding of Scrum roles, artifacts, and ceremonies.
