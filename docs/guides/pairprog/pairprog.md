# Pair Challenge Guide

![Team creating project backlog](./assets/PairProgramming_coders.jpeg)

## Overview

Pair programming is a proven technique that helps improve code quality, transfer knowledge between developers, and foster valuable collaboration skills and experience. At Chingu, we want to extend this practice to other roles as well, which is why we don't limit it to 'pair programming' alone. Roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner should also be able to solve challenges together. It's just as important for agile leaders to learn how others approach challenges within an agile team as it is for developers to learn how other coders think and tackle problems.

Through Chingu Pair Challenge you will:

- Meet a new people to solve a challenge
- Take what you know to the next level by sharing your knowledge with others
- Learn new technologies and techniques from your peers

> Every week we match people who are interested in learning and particapate in Pair Challenges to "level up".

## Prerequisites

Pair Challenge Sessions are scheduled daily by you. For now you have to join the #🟢Lobby channel to start the process, but in the future you will be able to schdule sessions a head of time.



## Your Responsibilities

Your primary responsibilities are to learn more about how Pair Challenges works, to help your partner achieve the same goal, and to hopefully make a new friend in the process.

This means you need to commit yourself to being responsive to your partner and participating in your scheduled Pair Challenge session(s).

## Steps to Follow


1. You may signup for a Pair Challenge Session by join the #🟢Lobby channel on Discord. Nobody will be able to talk in the lobby. Info can also be found in the #🍐pair-challenge channel.
2. Our bot, Parity, will send you a DM, so simply follow the steps (so make sure your privacy setting allow DM from people on our server)
3. Choose your role after signing up. Only Developer is available right now, but Agile Leader is coming soon
4. Choose difficulty (This is what you are comfortable with, challenge difficulty is marked on the challenges)
5. Wait for someone else with the same role and difficulty to signup, or ask around on the server to find someone that wants to join you
6. Once paired, the bot will create a private space for the two of you, and this is where you select challenge
    * Discuss carefully which challenge you wish to take before selecting one.
* Leaving the #🟢Lobby channel BEFORE you've been matched, will remove you from matchmaking.

> We suggest using the conferencing and screensharing that's built into Discord, but you may use any collaboration tool you prefer.

> If you have technical questions post them in the [`#coding-help`](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/1047615334703714394) channel. [Open a ticket](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/1193342042080817323) if you have a technical problem related to matching or the challenge process.

## Tips

1. Create your own voice channel by joining the [Voice Hub Channel](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/1130565532953882675). Use this to speak with your partner and share screen.
2. We know that you really want to solve the problems, but remember that it is more important to work on your communication, collaboration, and team skills than it is to just solve the problem. These are skills you can use on the job and ones that can help set you apart from other job candidates.
