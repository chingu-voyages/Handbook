![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

During your Voyage you will be using git and GitHub to maintain your code and to share it with your 
team. While many Chingu's are already familiar with these tools for individual projects, many are 
unfamiliar with how to use them in a team.

Get started before your Voyage begins:

* If you donâ€™t already have a **[GitHub account](https://github.com/)** create one (5 minutes)
* Set up **[Git on your computer & hook it up to GitHub authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)** (10 minutes)

these resources:
