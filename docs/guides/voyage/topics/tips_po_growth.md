Treat your team as your friends! You will be working with them for 6 weeks and to be a succesfull PO, you will need to connect with them on a personal level, build trust, and create a friendly and supportive environment where feedback is welcome and valued. This will create a collaborative environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing and sharing ideas, which result in continuous improvement and better product outcomes.

Actively listen, document, and analyze feedback to identify recurring themes and areas for improvement. Prioritize and implement changes accordingly to enhance your performance and to align with the needs of your team.
