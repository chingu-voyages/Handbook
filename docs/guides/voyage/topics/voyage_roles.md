The goal of all team members is to work together in a professional manner to identify, design, develop, and deploy a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for their project. Each one contributes to in different ways, using their own skills and meeting the responsibilities of their role.

All teammates must commit to following the Agile methodology and the Scrum framework that's
built on it. This means actively participating in team meetings and discussions, sharing daily status, and completing the tasks they volunteer to work on.

    <td><strong>Product Owner</strong></td>
    <td>Product Owners guide the team through a Voyage, following the Agile methodology and Scrum. 
    They are ["servant leaders"](https://www.greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/) who lead 
    through teamwork & motivation.<br/><br/>Specific PO 
    responsibilities include:
    <ul>
    <li>Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal through a Product Roadmap and
    Product Backlog</li>
    <li>Defining, prioritizing, and communicating items the product backlog</li>
    <li>Ensuring the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and clear</li>
    <li>Making sure everyone is represented and have a "voice" in the project</li>
    </ul>
    The PO also works closely with the Scrum Master by:
    <ul>
    <li>Participating in Sprint Planning, Review, and Retrospective meetings</li>
    <li>Actively listening to all ideas and concerns from the team</li>
    <li>Quickly resolving any issues or suggestions related to the backlog</li>
    <li>Working closely together to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders,
    including the development team, are met</li>
    </ul>
    PO's ensure that the backlog is visible to all team members and open to their ideas, suggestions, and revisions.<br/><br/>But, it is important that everyone on the team support their PO with open and honest feedback, and respect the guidance they provide. Guidance must be visible the Product Backlog, and shared in the Scrum events.<br/><br/>PO's are individuals, not committees. Teammates wanting to change the Product Backlog must do so through the PO and they must trust the PO's final decision.</br></br>Since so many issues are technical, Product Owners who have a strong background in technology, or who are also a developer, are often referred to as a <em>Technical Product Owner (TPO)</em>. You can learn more about this variant of the PO role in the <a href="https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/resources/glossary/glossary.md#glossary">Glossary</a>.
    <h4>PO Role Types</h4>
    Voyage PO's may assigned as <strong><i>Primary</i></strong> or <strong><i>Shadow</i></strong> Product Owners. Primary PO's have both the certifications and experience to effectively coordinate teams, while Shadow PO's need to observe an experienced PO before they are ready to be a Primary PO.</br></br>
    Primary PO's can be thought of as mentors for Shadow PO's. They help answer questions Shadow PO's may have, explain how PO responsibilities are carried out, and assign tasks to the Shadow (like leading a Sprint Planning session) when they are ready for additional responsibility.

    <td><strong>Scrum Master</strong></td>
    <td>
    The <em>Scrum Master (SM)</em> helps the development team understand Scrum theory and practice, 
    as defined in the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a>. SM's are 
    also accountable for the effectiveness of the team by enabling them to improve their practices, 
    within the Scrum framework.</br></br>
    The SM serves the team in the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Coaches team members in self-management and cross-functionality</li>

        </li>
        <li>Assists in avoiding and removing blockers to team‚Äôs progress</li>
        <li>Ensurs that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and timeboxed</li>
    </ul>
    The Scrum Master also works closely with the Product Owner by:
    <ul>
        <li>Uses effective techniques to define Product Goals and to manage the Product Backlog</li>
        <li>Helps the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items</li>
        <li>Establishes practical product planning for a complex environment</li>
        <li>Facilitates collaboration and communication across the team</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Scrum Master Role Types</h4>
    Chingu's may assigned as <strong><i>Primary</i></strong> or <strong><i>Shadow</i></strong> Scrum 
    Masters. Primary SM's have the certifications and experience to effectively coordinate teams, 
    while Shadow SM's need to observe an experienced SM before they are ready to be a Primary SM.
    </br></br>
    Primary SM's are mentors for Shadow SM's. They help answer questions Shadow SM's may have, explain how SM responsibilities are performed, and assign small tasks to the Shadow (like leading a Scrum events) when they are ready for additional responsibilities.

They create & maintain app sketches, storyboards, & prototypes, define styles and user interaction flows, and assist with Developer tasks as necessary.

        <li>Voyage Guides are available 1-2 hours per week to help answer questions and provide advice.</li>
        <li>Team members should research questions they have BEFORE asking their Voyage Guide.</li>
        <li>If your team has a Product Owner or Scrum Master direct questions about Agile/Scrum to them</li>
    </ul>
