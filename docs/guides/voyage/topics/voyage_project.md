# How should my Team select a project?
![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

If you are in a **Tier 1 or Tier 2** team this is easy! In your team channel we
have provided the requirements and specifications for the project you **must**
build. In these tiers you are not allowed to choose your own project.

If you are in a **Tier 3** team you have a choice to make - build the
project we have provided requirements and specifications for **or** build
requirements and specifications for a project of your choice.

If, as a Tier 3 team, you decide to build your own project here is a process
for making that decision. Remember this is a team decision and not a decision
any single team member can make.
