# What the tiers in a Voyage?
![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

Three _tiers_ are used to group people into teams based on their
current level of skill and expertise. These are:

* **Tier 1** - Getting started in your role (1-3 months experience)
* **Tier 2** - Intermediate skill level in your role (3-6 months experience)
* **Tier 3** - Experienced skill level in your role (6+ months experience)

The specific requirements for each of these varies by role. The definition of what's required
for each tier can be found [here](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/soloproject/soloproject.md#1-choose-your-tier-1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3).
