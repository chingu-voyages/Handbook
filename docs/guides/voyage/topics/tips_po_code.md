**Absolutely not!!!** ðŸ˜¾ It's certainly fine if you come to this
role with software development experience. But, you must **not**
contribute code to the project.

Your job is to help your team coordinate their efforts
to design, build, test, and deploy your MVP. Keep in mind that everyone on
the team is an *_subject matter expert_* in their role. So, the key to
working in a team is to trust your teammates and treat them as partners.

When you get in a situation where you feel overwhelmed by complexity,
technology, or terminology - reach out to your team for help. You may
think this is a sign of weakness, but it's actually a sign of strength and
maturity since it shows you trust your team. Doing this also helps to build
their confidence and experience.

Remember that none of us knows everything and if we did learn
it all it's just going to change ðŸ˜Š Rely on your teammates (as they 
rely on you) to reduce stress, conflict, to increase everyone's learning.
