No single team role is more important than any other! 

Different roles are needed because software projects are complex and they will only become more
complex over time.

Every member of the team brings different experiences and skills to contribute to the project. 
Each teammate is a **_subject matter expert (SME)_** in their respective role and should be
respected for the knowledge and skill they bring to the team.
