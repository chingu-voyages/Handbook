You will be assigned to a Voyage team based on the following criteria, from highest-to-lowest priority:

1. Tier

    All teammates will be in the same tier. This is the tier you selected on the [Voyage Signup form](https://forms.gle/NkSP7DS3oz4sEzdh8).

    For Development (Web or Python) teams:

    - Tier 1: Developers, plus Voyage Guides
    - Tier 2: Developers, plus Product Owners, Scrum Masters, UI/UX Designers, & Voyage Guides
    - Tier 3: Developers, plus Product Owners, Scrum Masters, UI/UX Designers, & Voyage Guides

    Keep in mind that Product Owners, Scrum Masters, UI/UX Designers, and
    Voyage Guides are added to teams if they are available.

2. Time Blocks

    We use the primary and alternate time block request you made when you signed up for a Voyage
    to match you with teammates who are available during the same blocks of time. This makes 
    communicating and collaborating simpler, makes it easier to find meeting times when everyone
    is available, and helps to build not just cross-functional teams, but also cross-cultural
    teams.

    You can learn more details about time blocks and how they work [here](./voyage_timeblocks.md).

3. Chingu Superstars

    We try to match Chingu Superstars, those who have donated to Chingu, in the same teams. Although donations aren't required, Chingu's who contribute have a lower Voyage drop out rate.

4. Technical Stack preferences

    We try to match team members on their technical stack preferences. We'll reach out to you prior to the start of your Voyage if we aren't able to match you to a team with the same tech stack preferences as yours.

5. Role-based teams

    Teams are also matched based on the roles participants signup with. Based on your role you'll be added to one of the following types of teams:

    * **Web Development** teams consist of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, 3-5 Web Developers, and a UI/UX Designer.
    * **Python Development** teams consist of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and 3-5 Python Developers

    Keep in mind that assigning Product Owners, Scrum Masters and UI/UX Designers to teams depends on how many Chingus in those roles signup for a Voyage.

6. Availability

    Teams are capped at 9 participants per team including:

    * 4-6 Developers
    * 1 UI/UX Designer
    * 1 Product Owner
    * 1 Scrum Master

    Teams will always have Developers and they may also have teammates in the
    other three roles, depending on whether or not Chingus in them and
    in the same tier and timezone range signup have signed up for the Voyage.
