# How are Voyage teams formed? 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

You will be assigned to a team by the Chingu Admins based on the following criteria, from highest-to-lowest priority:

1. Tier

    All participants in a team will be from the same tier. This is the tier you selected on the [Voyage Signup form](https://forms.gle/NkSP7DS3oz4sEzdh8).

    For Web Development teams:

    - Tier 1: Developers, plus Product Owners, Scrum Masters, & Voyage Guides
    - Tier 2: Developers, plus Product Owners, Scrum Masters, UI/UX Designers, & Voyage Guides
    - Tier 3: Developers, plus Product Owners, Scrum Masters, UI/UX Designers, & Voyage Guides

    For Data Science teams:
    - All tiers: Data Scientists

    Keep in mind that Product Owners, Scrum Masters, UI/UX Designers, and
    Voyage Guides are added to teams if they are available.

2. Timezone

    We try to match teams so no two teammates will be more than 2 timezones away from one another. This makes it easier to find times for meetings and pair programming sessions.

3. Chingu Superstars

    We also try to match Chingu Superstars, those who have donated to Chingu, in the same teams. Although donations aren't required Chingu's who do contribute have a lower probability of dropping out of a Voyage.

4. Technical Stack preferences

    We also try to match team members on their technical stack preferences. However, in the course of organizing Voyages over a period of years we've learned that communication & collaboration are better indicators of success. We'll reach out to you prior to the start of your Voyage if we aren't able to match you to a team with the same tech stack preferences as yours.

5. Role-based teams

    Teams are also matched based on the roles participants signup with. Based on your role you'll be added to one of the following types of teams:

    * **Web Development** teams consist of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, 3-5 Web Developers, and a UI/UX Designer.
    * **Data Science** teams consist of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and 3-5 Data Scientists

    Keep in mind that assigning Product Owners, Scrum Masters and UI/UX Designers to teams depend on how many Chingus in those roles signup for a Voyage. In addition, for Data Science teams, we'll reach out to Data Scientists if we don't have enough in your tier andtimezone to form a team. In this case you'll be given the option to join a Web Development team or to wait until the next Voyage.

6. Availability

    Teams are capped at 9 participants per team including:

    * 4-6 Developers
    * 1 UI/UX Designer
    * 1 Product Owner
    * 1 Scrum Master

    In addition, while teams will always have Developers, they will have the
    other three roles depending on whether or not Chingus in the other roles
    in the same tier and timezone range signup for the Voyage.
