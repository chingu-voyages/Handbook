![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

During 6-week long Voyage you will learn new technical skills, refine the skills you have already 
worked hard to build, and learn "soft" skills like teamwork, Agile Development, planning, & design. 
In other words, the skills that will help set you apart from other job candidates.

Chingu doesn't charge for organizing & managing Voyages. But, that doesn't mean they are "free". 
Getting the most out of your Voyage requires dedication and commitment to be an active participant 
and to finish what you start.

- Be an active participant rather than a passive observer.
- Set aside an average of 8-12 hours per week for your Voyage.
- Share your status **daily** in your Team channel.
- Submit the weekly Voyage Check-In form we‚Äôll provide each week so the Admin team will understand 
not just how you are doing, but also how we can improve.

We know you can do this and you'll find the impact on your career will be worth the effort.
