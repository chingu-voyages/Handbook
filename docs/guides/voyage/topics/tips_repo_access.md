# What should I do if I don't have access to my team repo‚ùì
![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

We provide a GitHub repo in the `chingu-voyages` GitHub organization for every team. We also grant  
`Admin` privileges on it to every team member.

If this is your first Voyage, GitHub will send an email notification as part of this process.
**_You must click the link_** in that email to validate your identity and get access to your team 
repo.

If you haven't received this email, please check the *_junk_* or *_spam_* folder in your email. If 
it's not there, you can go to the [`chingu-voyages`](https://github.com/chingu-voyages)
organization in GitHub and click on the `View invitation` button. From there you can validate your 
identity.

You can ask other Chingu's for advice in the 
[`#coding-help` channel](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/1047615334703714394)
or you may open a ticket to the Chingu Admin team in the 
[`#open-support-ticket` channel](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/1105911757177888908).
