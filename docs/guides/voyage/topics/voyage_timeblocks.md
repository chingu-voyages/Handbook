## 🌐 Team Availability Guidelines

To make collaboration across time zones simpler and more flexible, team members can choose their **preferred working blocks**.

---

### 🕒 How It Works

#### **Pick Your Blocks**
- Each member selects **one primary block** and **one alternative block (optional)** from the available time blocks: **Dawn, Daylight, Twilight, Dusk**.
- These blocks define when you’re mostly available for **synchronous team meetings**.
- We will place you with others who picked the **same time block**. If we can’t find a match in your first preference, 
    - We will use your **alternate block** instead.
    - If no alternate time block was selected, we will notify you and schedule your participation in the next voyage.
  
#### **Availability Requirement**
- You **do not need to be available for the entire block**, but should be available for **at least half of the block’s duration**.
- This ensures meetings and collaboration can happen smoothly.

#### **Meeting Frequency**
- Teams will have **1–2 meetings per week**, depending on group preference and availability.
- Meetings will be scheduled primarily within your chosen block.

### 💬 Asynchronous Work
- Outside your team's scheduled meeting times, the team will operate **asynchronously**.
- Updates, handoffs, and progress tracking should happen in **shared tools or channels**, keeping everyone aligned across time zones.

---

### ✅ Benefits
- 🌍 Flexibility to work in your **preferred hours**.
- ⏰ Guaranteed overlap for **meaningful synchronous collaboration**.
- 🤝 Reduced time zone friction and fewer **“always-online” expectations**.



## 🌎 Global Time Zone Conversion Table (Based on UTC Blocks)

Each block is 6 hours long, based on UTC.  

To identify the Time Block name ("Dawn", "Daylight", "Twilight", or "Dusk") that correspond to your preferred working time you should follow these steps:

1. Use the Time Blocks table located at: Handbook/docs/guides/voyage/topics/voyage_timeblocks.md
   * The leftmost column represents the local timezone a Voyager is located in
   * The remaining columns map the time in the Voyagers timezone to a UTC-0 time

2. Locate your local timezone in the leftmost column of this table.

3. Next, in that row locate the time for your primary availability - the time of day you will be available to work with your Voyage teammates.

4. Now, if you have another block of time when you are available find the time block name in the heading of the column containing this alternate working time. Otherwise, you won't need an alternate availability (see [Pick Your Blocks](#pick-your-blocks) above).

Finally, repeat this process to identify your alternate working time.
