## 🌐 Team Availability Guidelines

To make collaboration across time zones simpler and more flexible, team members can choose their **preferred working blocks**.

---

### 🕒 How It Works

#### **Pick Your Blocks**
- Each member selects **one primary block** and **one alternative block (optional)** from the available time blocks: **Dawn, Daylight, Twilight, Dusk**.
- These blocks define when you’re mostly available for **synchronous team meetings**.
- We will place you with others who picked the **same time block**. If we can’t find a match in your first preference, 
    - We will use your **alternate block** instead.
    - If no alternate time block was selected, we will notify you and schedule your participation in the next voyage.
  
#### **Availability Requirement**
- You **do not need to be available for the entire block**, but should be available for **at least half of the block’s duration**.
- This ensures meetings and collaboration can happen smoothly.

#### **Meeting Frequency**
- Teams will have **1–2 meetings per week**, depending on group preference and availability.
- Meetings will be scheduled primarily within your chosen block.

### 💬 Asynchronous Work
- Outside your team's scheduled meeting times, the team will operate **asynchronously**.
- Updates, handoffs, and progress tracking should happen in **shared tools or channels**, keeping everyone aligned across time zones.

---

### ✅ Benefits
- 🌍 Flexibility to work in your **preferred hours**.
- ⏰ Guaranteed overlap for **meaningful synchronous collaboration**.
- 🤝 Reduced time zone friction and fewer **“always-online” expectations**.

### 🧭 How to Use

1. Find your timezone in the table.
2. Each cell shows what time (in your local zone) each **UTC block** happens.
3. Choose a **primary block** and an **alternate block** where you can be available at least **half of the time** (≈3 hours).
4. Teams meet **1–2 times per week**, and work asynchronously outside those blocks.
