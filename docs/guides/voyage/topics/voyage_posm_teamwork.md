# How should PO's and Scrum Masters work together?
![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

When in the same team the focus of Product Owners and Scrum Masters must be to work 
together to support and coordinate the team. You should operate as an Agile Team of two.

This will take a lot of communication and cooperation with one another to ensure that
your teammate get the support and guidance they need as they learn and follow Agile/Scrum.
Remember that for many, if not all, of your teammates this will be the first time they
have been exposed to Agile/Scrum.

Here are some tips you should follow:

1. Product Owners and Scrum Masters are coordinators, **not managers**. In Chingu Voyage
teams everyone is at the same level. This means you shouldn't order or boss your teammates.
Instead, you should advise, suggest and work to build concensus by motivating the team.

2. You should read and understand and practice [Scrum Values](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-values) along with the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and the
[12 Agile Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Use these as your
"guideposts" for the Voyage.

3. Product Owners and Scrum Masters should throughly understand their roles before the
Voyage starts. You can learn about the expectations and requirements of your role [here](./voyage_roles.md).

4. Once the Voyage starts you should meet to discuss your responsibilities, your expectations,
and the expectations you have of each other. Remember POs & Scrum Masters form a team within 
the Voyage team - an Agile Team.

5. You don't have to have all the answers. Consult with each other and your Voyage team
when you need advice and help. In addition, a member of Chingu's Agile Leadership team are
assigned to POs and Scrum Masters so you'll have an Agile/Scrum coach when you need expert
advice.

6. There will be disagreements within the team during any Voyage. Most will be minor and
will center around the technology you are using to build your project. But, some may be
more serious and may become heated. If this happens remember to separate fact from emotion.
Also keep in mind that at Chingu we want teams to work outside their comfort zone, which means you'll make mistakes. This is not only okay it is encouraged since there's a lot to learn from
mistakes.

Finally, remember that no one on a team succeeds or fails by themselves. Everyone on the team
will succeed or fail together. So, be supportive and kind to your teammates.
