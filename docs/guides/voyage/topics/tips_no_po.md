# My team doesn't have a Product Owner. What should we do‚ùì
![Voyage topic banner](../assets/horizontal-paint-splash-green.jpg)

In a Voyage, Product Owner's will be added to teams depending on *_how many sign up_*.

Don't worry if your team doesn't have a Product Owner! Follow the steps in the Voyage
section of the Handbook to determine what needs to be done, in what order, and how to
perform each step.

In past Voyages teams without a Product Owner have used one of the following strategies:

1. Someone on your team can volunteer to be the Product Owner. This works
best if someone on the team has previous experience working on a team with a PO or if they are familiar with Scrum and the Agile Methodology.

2. Team members can rotate the PO responsibilities in each Sprint. This
ensures that everyone gets a chance to learn more about this role.

3. Team members can agree to share the PO responsibilities with one another. This is the least desirable option, since shared responsibility often means it's not done.

Whichever option you choose, remember that teammates must support one
another -- you will either succeed together or fail together.
