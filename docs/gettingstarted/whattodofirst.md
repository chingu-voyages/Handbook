## Create and submit your Solo Project

The [Solo Project](../guides/soloproject/soloproject.md) helps you validate that you have
the necessary technical skills to be successful in a Voyage. It's also another
way to build an app for your portfolio.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Choose your tier] --> B{Do you already\nhave a project?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Submit your\nSolo Project]
    B -- No --> D[Create from\nChingu Specs]
    D --> C
    C --> E[Evaluator\ngives feedback]
    E --> F((Signup for\na Voyage))
```

You'll first need to choose the [tier](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/soloproject/soloproject.md#1-choose-your-tier-1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-2%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3) that matches your
current skill level. There are three tiers and ou should select the one that
best matches your curren skill level - beginner (Tier 1),
intermediate (Tier 2), or experienced (Tier 3).

If you already have a project that matches your tier
go ahead and submit it for evaluation. Your project can be one you've completed
on your own or as a part of a team. It should meet these criteria:

- It must coorespond to the requirements of the tier you've selected
- It should be original work (not copied from someone else, including a tutorial)
- If created as part of a team you should be a major contributor to the project

When you are done, submit a [Solo Project Completion form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdN3dN7OjzppDCBNIsIf-bOJC_XAlQ9eiPcYQx_m6DfhaiRmA/viewform) so we can evaluate your project.
(Note: please use the same email as your application form)

One of our Evaluators will evaluate your Solo Project and will DM you in
Discord with feedback you can use! They will look at both your code as well
as the running app so you'll get 360-degree feedback.

Please check your `Message Requests` or spam folder on discord. If you have not received a DM in 5 days after submission, feel free to open a ticket to check the status.

Once you've passed the Solo Project, you will receive a link to sign up for the next voyage, and a confirmation form closer to the start date, you'll be ready to participate in a Voyage!

## Sign up to Participate in a Voyage

Voyages are 6-week long remote team projects where you'll build a web app
while refining your technical skills and adding new "soft" skills, like Agile.

You can find the schedule of upcoming Voyages in the
[#voyage-schedule](https://discord.com/channels/330284646283608064/913775964138393611)
channel in Discord.

To signup simply complete and submit a [Voyage Signup](https://forms.gle/QGLbjKubYVfmSLMJ7) form. We’ll email an acknowledgement with information to help you get ready.

## Join a Pair Programming session

While you are waiting for your Voyage to start you might wish to join in one of
our weekly Pair Programming sessions. Pair Programming with another Chingu will
help you learn with a like-minded professional and expand your network.

You can learn more about what Pair Programming is and how to get started
[here](../guides/pairprog.md).
