# Programs & Services

The goal of Chingu programs is to provide you with opportunities to practice
what you've learned in university, bootcamps, and online courses to transform
your Software Development knowledge into the experience employers are looking
for.  

- A ***Solo Project*** is required before your first Voyage. It lets you
validate the tier level you've chosen and verify that you are committed to
completing a Voyage.
- ***Voyages*** are like [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon),
but of a longer duration to allow the applications you'll be developing to be more full
featured. You'll work with a team of remote Developers working in an environment that
mimics what you'll encounter in the workplace
- ***Pair Programming*** is a program which partners you with another developer
to complete short challenges together in real time. You'll help and learn from
each other to improve your skills.
- ***Moonshots*** are special assignments given to select Tier 3 teams during a
Voyage. These are generally standalone applications that address specific
member needs or which help add value to the Chingu organization. For example,
an app like [Chingu Quiz](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/moonshot-chingu-quiz).

Voyages, Pair Programming, and Moonshots are open to all Chingus. You can apply
to take part in these once you've [applied to join Chingu](https://chingu.io/)
and completed your [Solo Project](../guides/soloproject/soloproject.md).
